# VNTU-navigation

IN PROCESS... :(

Problems:
1) How to make pathfinding in all floors
2) How to translate all fucking building plan of university in program, without knowledge about real distance between cabinets and real scale of building.
3) What method I can use to compress all building plan with cabinets in <2mb? I had bad idea to create some images, but its bullshit. So I think, that I can use some of esoteric methods(how I love), that
use <5 percent of CPU, but not big percent of memory.
4) How to optimize the program? I had experience with chunks in stuped-javaFX-2D-Game, but currently I don't have full realizing, how to optimize my "esoteric" methods. I know, that
that VNTU has 8 campuses, in beginning my general target is 5 main campuses. Maybe I should to create class Campus or Building, that consist xy corrdinates, and than i can calculate, is the 
building in screen.

Ideas:
Make program, that implement all functional in imaginary buildings. If this works, translate real VNTU throught pain.

Simple navigation program for VNTU university written in java and LibGDX. I think it should not use GPS.
